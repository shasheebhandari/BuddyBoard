## 10/16/2025 12 PM - placed the components   

i finalized the components i am going to use and imported the library in kicad and added them in the sch editor . I will be using esp32 s3 , mpu 6050 , 3 usb c ports , one oled and a bme680 sensor. one usb c will be used as upstream usb to power everything whereas 2 usb will be used for powering other things so just downstream ports

## 10/16/2025 4 PM - assignined names values and footprints   

In this 3 hour , i imported the symbols and footprints from 3rd party library .
It was hard to configure the type of symbol and values at first .
it Literally took me 2 hours just to set things up and give name to it .

I gave name to all the components by the value feature of kicad , then i gave it the footprints it required to make the pcb . 

Now i will do the connections between all the components in the next 4 hour session 

-image1 : image  of the naming i gave . I followed standard practice for naming the components ![Screenshot 2025-10-16 164345.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjQ2OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e7ec69cbc85c6116b5b0fedbf24a8a2dee7a924a/Screenshot%202025-10-16%20164345.png)
