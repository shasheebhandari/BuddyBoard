## 10/16/2025 12 PM - placed the components   

i finalized the components i am going to use and imported the library in kicad and added them in the sch editor . I will be using esp32 s3 , mpu 6050 , 3 usb c ports , one oled and a bme680 sensor. one usb c will be used as upstream usb to power everything whereas 2 usb will be used for powering other things so just downstream ports

## 10/16/2025 4 PM - assignined names values and footprints   

In this 3 hour , i imported the symbols and footprints from 3rd party library .
It was hard to configure the type of symbol and values at first .
it Literally took me 2 hours just to set things up and give name to it .

I gave name to all the components by the value feature of kicad , then i gave it the footprints it required to make the pcb . 

Now i will do the connections between all the components in the next 4 hour session 

-image1 : image  of the naming i gave . I followed standard practice for naming the components ![Screenshot 2025-10-16 164345.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjQ2OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e7ec69cbc85c6116b5b0fedbf24a8a2dee7a924a/Screenshot%202025-10-16%20164345.png)

## 10/17/2025 - almost done with planning the connections (almost died)  

ok so today i opened kicad thinking yeah i’ll just do some neat routing and finish early. big lie. big mistake. the blue lines are everywhere. they move. they taunt me. i swear one of them changed direction just to confuse me.

decided to be smart and plan things first. gnd first then power then signal. but now it looks like all of them got mixed up and had a party on my board. even gnd is judging me.

erc check keeps screaming at me like some angry robot. "clearance violation" "unconnected pad" "floating net" ok chill bro im floating too.

i moved the same component like 18 times. nothing fits. every time i think its fine, kicad says nope. feels personal at this point.

had a brilliant strategy written down —
nets : gnd of usbs, sda scl between i2c things
strategy : divide 5v, route vbus, send data to esp
yeah sounds cool until i actually try to do it. now it’s just chaos and regret.

also i think my brain has officially short circuited. maybe i need ground stitching vias for my sanity.

anyway i look like im planning or something but mostly just staring at the screen thinking “why so many connections”
tbh i dont know what i even did today . just stared at the screen for 4 hours with no visible solutions ![Screenshot 2025-10-17 161320.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjYyOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8ca19fb55ea075bd73f2c99e06c5dfeaf0c9043b/Screenshot%202025-10-17%20161320.png)

end of log. tomorrow we fight again. maybe. 
  

## 10/18/2025 - started doing the connecrions and i almost lost my sanity  

okayy guys i am still alive somehow but not sure if i still have my sanity or it got shorted somewhere between vbus and cc1  these last 6 hours have been pure madness . first i thought i’ll be smart and wire all the usbs together you know nice and clean like those cool youtube pcb tutorials . yeah no . five minutes later it looked like someone dropped a bowl of blue noodles on my screen .

routing vbus and cc1 cc2 was like playing twister with electricity . every time i fixed one connection another one screamed at me . even the whole a4 workspace was looking tooo small like bro where did all my space go i just placed 3 components what the heck .

at one point i zoomed out and just stared at it wondering if i accidentally designed a subway map instead of a pcb . tried to move one trace and the entire board said nah we moving too .

the erc check keeps bullying me like "clearance violation" ok fine but have u seen my life clearance lately 
i swear kicad enjoys this pain its sitting there like "hmm lets throw another unconnected net just for fun"

anyway i think i invented new swear words today while chasing that one missing gnd connection . still not sure if i found it or just gave up emotionally .

coffee count : 4
brain cells : 0
progress : questionable

but hey the board looks kinda artistic now if you squint hard enough maybe picasso would be proud

ok log done for today i need to go stare at a wall that doesn’t have blue lines on it

## 10/19/2025 - finished connections and routing of the pcb   

Due to festive season here in Nepal , my progress has been really really slow . I tried few lock in periods but i wasnt that succesful , 

Here's the update since last journal :
1. I finished most of the connections in sch file.  ![Screenshot 2025-10-16 123937.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzE5MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--05206510505201855584a7f30afc6faf3fb468f4/Screenshot%202025-10-16%20123937.png)

2. I converted the sch to the pcb . 
It literally took me so much time to route the pcb and pass those drc . Had almost 300+ error in the first drc run but after a 3 hr grind i was able to complete it .

I finally completed the pcb part of the project . I need to upload the file to the github and make one 3d printed case for the pcb . see ya!
